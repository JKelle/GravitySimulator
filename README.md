GravitySimulator
================

Objects of different size (mass) will interact with a gravitational field and engage in elastic collisions.
The number of and types of objects in the space can only be changed in the source code for now.

How to Play:
* Play/Pause: space bar (or button)
* Inc/Dec Gravity: up/down arrow keys (or buttons)
* Add a center of gravity: Alt+click
* Clicking a block will show it and it's velocity data in the top section of the panel.

Hints:
* Try making gravity negative to observe repulsion.
* Try adding multiple centers of gravity.
* Try adding several centers of gravity on top of each other. This can give the effect of having different centers having differnt strengths.
